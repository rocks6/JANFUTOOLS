//This module is for showing or hiding markers based on what side they belong to.
//Module is a durect port from Olsen framework v5 from Arma 2 so untested if working in A3, no need for use but added just in case. 
//ADDMARKER(SIDE, NAME)
//SIDE is the side of the marker, NAME is the name of the marker.
//If you dont want anyone to see the marker use SYSTEM.

//Example:
//ADDMARKER(west, "start");
//ADDMARKER(SYSTEM, "objBravo");
